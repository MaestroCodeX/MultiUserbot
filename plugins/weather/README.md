# Weather
Display the weather for a city

## Needed setup
-   Go to <https://home.openweathermap.org/> and register an account for free.
-   Go to <https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys> and, if needed, login and take the free api key
-   Open `apikey.ini` with your favourite editor and add your api key

## Note
These steps might not be necessary but it's suggested as the shared api key could get blocked, limiited or just disabled by an high request number
